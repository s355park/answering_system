Axioms of Probability 2.1 Introduction In this chapter we introduce the concept of the probability of an event and then show how these probabilities can be computed in certain situations. This is based on deﬁning the concept of the sample space. Consider an experiment whose outcome is not predictable with certainty. However, although the outcome of the experiment will not be known in advance, let us suppose that the set of all possible outcomes is known. This set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is known as the sample space of the experiment. 2.2 Sample Space and Events Experiment : An experiment is a procedure which results in an outcome. In general, the outcome of an experiment depends on the conditions under which the experiment is performed. Deterministic Experiment : In a deterministic experiment , the observed result (outcome) is not subject to chance. This means that if we repeat a deterministic experiment under exactly the same conditions, we will get the same result. Random Experiment : In a random experiment , the outcome is subject to chance. This means that if the experiment is repeated, the outcome may be diﬀerent from time to time. Statistical Regularity : Suppose that a random experiment is repeated for a large number of times. We say that the experiment has statistical regularity if the fraction of times that a particular event E is observed tends to some limit. Note : In this course, we consider only experiments which are repeatable and the outcomes of the experiment exhibit statistical regularity. Sample Space : For any random experiment, we deﬁne the sample space S to be the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment. Elementary event : An elementary event E is a single element of S corresponding to a particular outcome of the experiment. Event : An event is any subset of S (a collection of elementary events or outcomes). ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 10 Union of Some Events : The union of events E 1 , E 2 , . . . E n is deﬁned the event for which at least one of E i s occurs and denoted by n [ i =1 E i . Intersection of Some Events : The intersection of events E 1 , E 2 , . . . E n is deﬁned the event for which all of E i s occur and denoted by n \ i =1 E i . Complement of An Event : Consider an even E . The complement of E (denoted as E c ) is the event that E does not occur. We have, EE c  = ∅ , E ∪ E c  = S . S E E c Figure 1: Complement of an event E . ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 11 Partitioning of Sample Space : The events F 1 , F 2 , . . . , F n form a partition of S if they are disjoint and their union is S . This means that, (i) n [ i =1 E i = S (ii) E i E j = ∅ , i ̸ = j S F 2 F 3 F n . . . F 1 Figure 2: Partition of the sample space. If F 1 , F 2 , . . . , F n form a partition of the sample space, then, for any event E ⊂ S , we have, E = n [ i =1 ( EF i ) , where ( EF i )( EF j ) = ∅ , for i ̸ = j (1) S F 2 F n F 1 S F 2 F n F 1 EF 1 . . .

Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 12 Some Properties of Union and Intersection Commutative laws: E ∪ F = F ∪ E EF = FE Associative laws: ( E ∪ F ) ∪ G = E ∪ ( F ∪ G ) ( EF ) G = E ( FG ) Distributive laws: ( E ∪ F ) G = EG ∪ FG ( EF ) ∪ G = ( E ∪ G )( F ∪ G ) Note that, E ∅ = ∅ , ES = E, E ∪∅ = E, E ∪ S = S DeMorgan’s laws are as follows  n [ i =1 E i ! c = n \ i =1 E c i  n \ i =1 E i ! c = n [ i =1 E c i Note that F and F  c  parition the space, i.e., FF  c  = ∅ and F ∪ F  c  = S , as a result, for any given E we have, E = EF  c  ∪ EF, where ( EF  c )( EF ) = ∅ This is illustrated in Fig. 4.

Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 13 2.3 Axioms of Probability Relative Frequency : Consider a random experiment with a sample space S and let E be a particular outcome of E . This means that the event (outcome) E is an element of the set S , i.e., E ∈ S . Assume that the experiment is repeated for n times and the total number of times that the event E has occurred is equal to n ( E ) . The ratio n ( E ) /n is called the relative frequency of the event E . Relative frequency of an event has the property that 0 ≤ n ( E ) /n ≤ 1 , where n ( E ) /n = 0 if E occurs in none of the n trials and n ( E ) /n = 1 if E occurs in all of the n trials. Probability : The probability of the event E is deﬁned as, P ( E ) = lim n →∞ n ( E ) n (2) The probability P ( E ) of an event E satisﬁes the following axioms: (i) 0 ≤ P ( E ) ≤ 1 . (ii) P ( S ) = 1 . (iii) If E 1 , E 2 , . . . are disjoint events, i.e., E i E j = ∅ when i ̸ = j , then P  ∞ [ i =1 E i ! = ∞ X i =1 P ( E i ) As a result of above axioms: P ( ∅ ) = 0 ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 14 2.4 Some Simple Propositions The probability P ( E ) of an event E satisﬁes the following properties: (i) P ( E c ) = 1 − P ( E ) . (ii) If E ⊂ F , then P ( E ) ≤ P ( F ) . (iii) P ( E ∪ F ) = P ( E ) + P ( F ) − P ( EF ) . (iv) P ( E 1 ∪ E 2 ∪· · · ∪ E n ) = n X i =1 P ( E i ) − X i 1 <i 2 P ( E i 1 E i 2 ) + · · · + ( − 1) r +1 X i 1 <i 2 < ··· i r P ( E i 1 E i 2 · · · E i r ) + · · · + ( − 1) n +1 P ( E 1 E 2 · · · E n ) where the sum ( − 1) r +1 P i 1 <i 2 < ··· i r  P ( E i 1 E i 2  · · · E i r ) is over  n r ! terms. 2.5 Sample Spaces Having Equally Likely Outcomes For a Sample Space having N equally likely outcomes, P ( { 1 } ) = P ( { 2 } ) = · · · = P ( { N } ) = 1 N Probability of any event E is P ( E ) = number of points in E number of points in S ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 15 2.6 Some Solved Problems 1. Let A, B and C be three arbitrary sets in a sample space S . In terms of these sets ﬁnd set-theoretic expressions for the following events in terms of A, B and C : (i) Only A occurs, (ii) Both A and B but not C occur (iii) All three events occur (iv) At least one event occurs (v) At least two events occur (vi) Exactly one event occurs (vii) Exactly two events occur (viii) No event occurs (ix) Not more than two of the events occur.

A three digit number ( 000 to 999 ) is chosen at random. Find the probability that exactly one of the digits in the number is greater than 5 . Find the probability that at least one of the digits in the number is greater than 5 . Solution: One of the digits must be 6 , 7 , 8 or 9 and the other two must be 0 to 5 , inclusive. There are three ways to choose the digit that will be greater than 5 and 4 ways to ﬁll the position. There are 6 × 6 ways of ﬁlling the remaining two positions. The total number of points satisfying the criteria is 3 × 4 × 6 × 6 = 432 points and the probability is . 432 . 3. A coin is tossed until for the ﬁrst time the same result appears twice in succession. To every possible outcome requiring n tosses, attribute a probability of 1 / 2 n − 1 . Describe the sample space of this experiment. Find the probability of the events: (i) The experiment stops before the 6 toss. (ii) An even number of tosses is required. Solution: Sample space: probability HH TT 1/4 HTT THH 1/8 HTHH THTT 1/16 · · · · · · · (i) Probability experiment ends before the sixth toss is 2 × (1 / 4 + 1 / 8 + 1 / 16 + 1 / 32) = 15 / 16 . (ii) Probability experiment ends on an even number of tosses: 2 × ( 1 4 + 1 16 + · · · ) = 2 × 1 / 4 1 − 1 / 4 = 2 / 3 4. A box contains ﬁve tags marked with the integers 1 to 5. Three tags are drawn from the box without replacement. Describe the sample space and the following events: (i) E 1 is the sum of the tag numbers is 12 (ii) E 2 corresponds to at least one tag of the tags being a 5 (iii) E 1 E 2 (iv) Repeat the question if the experiment is with replacement. Solution: The sample space consists of 3-tuples of distinct integers from 1 to 5 and there are 5 × 4 × 3 such points. (i) E 1 is the set of 3-tuples whose integers add to 12 - there are three such points: (3,4,5) and its permutations. (ii) E 2 is the set of points containing a 5. For a 5 in the ﬁrst position, there are 4 × 3 ways of ﬁlling the other two positions. As there are 3 ways of placing the 5, the total number of points in E 2 is 3 × 4 × 3 = 36 . ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 16 (iii) E 1 E 2 = E 1 . (iv) The sample space now contains 5 3  points. E 1 consists of the points (5,5,2) and its permutations (3 points), (5,4,3) and its permutations (6 points) and (4,4,4) . E 2 consists of points of the form: (5,5,5), (5,5,X) where X < 5 (12 points) and (5,X,Y), both X and Y < 5 (48 points - count them). E 1 E 2 consists of the points adding to 12 with at least one 5; namely the points (5,5,2) and its permutations (3 points) and (5,4,3) and its permutations (6 points). 5. An experiment consists of choosing two people and determining which day of the week their birthday falls on in the current year. Describe a sample space for this experiment and describe the following events (i) E 1 the birthdays fall on the same day (ii) E 2 at least one birthday is on a Friday. Solution: Without loss of generality assume there is an order in the experiment i.e. the two people are questioned sequentially. The the sample space consists of the 49 points: S = { ( x, y ) , x, y = Sunday, Monday, · · · , Saturday } where the ﬁrst coordinate refers to the ﬁrst person and the second, the second. Then E 1 = { ( x, x ) } , | E 1 | = 7 and E 2 = { ( Friday , y ) , ( x, Friday ) } , | E 2 | = 13 . 6. A die is tossed three times. Describe a suitable sample space for this experiment. Describe the following events and determine the number of points: (i) A = { exactly two sixes were obtained } (ii) B = { the sum of the faces showing is 12 } (iii) C = { all faces show an even number } Describe also the events AB, AC, ABC . Solution: The sample space might consist of the 6 3  points { ( i, j, k ) , 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ 6 } where the i th coordinate reports the outcome on the i th toss. (i) A = { 2 sixes } and contains points of the form { (6 , 6 , 1) , (6 , 6 , 2) , · · · (1 , 6 , 6) , · · · (5 , 6 , 6) } Clearly | A | = 15 . (ii) B = { sum of faces is 12 } and contains points such as (1 , 6 , 5) , (1 , 5 , 6) , (2 , 6 , 4) , (2 , 4 , 6) , · · · and contains, by direct counting, 25 points. (iii) C = { all faces even } and contains 3 3  points such as (2 , 2 , 2) , (2 , 2 , 4) , · · · . By direct veriﬁcation, AB = ∅ , AC contains six points and ABC = ∅ . 7. Ten people enter an elevator on the ground ﬂoor and get oﬀ, at random, at one of eight ﬂoors above ground. Describe a suitable sample space and ﬁnd the probability that exactly one person gets oﬀon the ﬁfth ﬂoor. Solution: An appropriate sample space for this situation is that of dropping ten balls (people) into eight cells (ﬂoors) which consists of 8 10  points i.e. ten-tuples with each coordinate place containing an integer from 1 to 8 . Each point is equally likely and the probability that exactly one person gets oﬀon the ﬁfth ﬂoor is the number of points containing one 5 divided by 8 10 . The number of such points is 10 × 7 9  since the coordinate position containing the 5 can be one of 10, and the other coordinate positions can contain any of 7 integers (anything but a 5 ). ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 17 8. You are dealt two cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. What is the probability you will obtain a pair (both cards have the same number or picture on them)? What is the probability the two cards will have the same suit? (It is assumed the ﬁrst card is NOT replaced into the deck before the second card is dealt.) Solution: There are   52 2  distinct pairs of cards possible (no order). Within a given number (or picture) card there are   4 2  ways of obtaining a pair. There are 13 such numbers and the total number of ways of obtaining a pair is 13 ×   4 2  . The probability is then P ( pair ) = 13 ×  4 2 !  52 2 ! . By a similar reasoning the probability of obtaining a pair with the same suit is P ( pair with the same suit ) = 4 ×  13 2 !  52 2 ! . 9. Choose a positive integer at random and cube it. What is the probability the last two digits of the cube are both ones? Solution: Consider the base 10 expansion of an integer x + y · 10 + z · 10 2  + · · · ( 0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 9) , and cube it to give: x 3  + 3 x 2 y · 10 + 3 xy 2  · 10 2  + · · · The only digit of the original number is x and the only digit, when cubed gives a 1 in the least signiﬁcant position is 1 . Thus x = 1 . Similarly for the second least signiﬁcant digit to be a 1 we must the least signiﬁcant digit of 3 x 2  be a 1 and the only value for which this happens, give x = 1 is y = 7 . Thus only cubes of numbers ending in 71 gives numbers ending in 11 . Thus the probability of the cube of a randomly chosen integer ending in 11 is approximately . 01 (approximately because we could choose single digit numbers etc. 10. Each of nine balls are placed with equal probability in one of three boxes. Find the probability that: (a) there will be three balls in each box.. (b) There will be four balls in one box, three in another and two in the other. Solution: (a) The sample space contains ordered 9 -tuples, each position ﬁlled with one of three integers - total number of points is 3 9 . The number of these points containing 3 ones, 3 twos and 3 threes is  9 3 ! ×  6 3 ! ×  3 3 ! and the probability follows. (b) Similarly P ( 4 in one box, 3 in another and 2 in the other ) =  9 4 ! 5 3 ! 2 2 ! 3 9 . ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 18 11. In a batch of manufactured units, 2% of the units have the wrong weight (and perhaps also the wrong color), 5% have the wrong color (and perhaps also the wrong weight), and 1% have both the wrong weight and the wrong color. A unit is taken at random from the batch. What is the probability that the unit is defective in at least one of the two respects? Solution: Let A be the event that “the unit has the wrong weight” and B the event that “the unit has the wrong color”. The model that we have chosen then shows that P ( A ) = 0 . 02; P ( B ) = 0 . 05; P ( AB ) = 0 . 01 . Using the “Addition Theorem for Two Events” which states that P ( A ∪ B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) − P ( AB ) we conclude that the desired probability is given by P ( A ∪ B ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) − P ( AB ) = 0 . 02 + 0 . 05 − 0 . 01 = 0 . 06 . 12. Let us select one of the ﬁve-digit numbers 00000, 00001,..., 99999 at random. What is the probability that the number only contains the digits 0 and 1? Solution: We let each possible number correspond to one outcome. The number of possible cases is then 10 5 . The number of favorable cases is seen to be 2 5 , for there are two favorable digits in each of the ﬁve positions. Using the First Deﬁnition of Probability which states that if the probability of the outcomes in a given experiment are the same, then the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the number of possible cases, we conclude that the desired probability is 2 5 / 10 5 =0.00032. Now let us compute the probability that the digits in the random number are all diﬀerent. The number of favorable cases is now 10 · 9 · 8 · 7 · 6 = 30 , 240 (any of the 10 digits can come ﬁrst, then 1 of 9 digits can come second, and so on). Hence the probability is 30 , 240 / 10 5  = 0 . 3024 . 13. Consider the event of rolling two dice. Determine the probability that at least one 4 appears on the dice. Solution: The sample space is as follows: (1 , 1) (2 , 1) (3 , 1) (4 , 1) (5 , 1) (6 , 1) (1 , 2) (2 , 2) (3 , 2) (4 , 2) (5 , 2) (6 , 2) (1 , 3) (2 , 3) (3 , 3) (4 , 3) (5 , 3) (6 , 3) (1 , 4) (2 , 4) (3 , 4) (4 , 4) (5 , 4) (6 , 4) (1 , 5) (2 , 5) (3 , 5) (4 , 5) (5 , 5) (6 , 5) (1 , 6) (2 , 6) (3 , 6) (4 , 6) (5 , 6) (6 , 6) There 36 elements in the sample space. The number of elements of sample space having at least one four is equal to 11 . The corresponding probability is 11 / 36 . Note that we could also solve this problem using the expression for the probability of the union of two events. 14. Consider the event of rolling two dice. To visualize the set of outcomes, it is useful to use the following table: (1 , 1) (2 , 1) (3 , 1) (4 , 1) (5 , 1) (6 , 1) (1 , 2) (2 , 2) (3 , 2) (4 , 2) (5 , 2) (6 , 2) (1 , 3) (2 , 3) (3 , 3) (4 , 3) (5 , 3) (6 , 3) (1 , 4) (2 , 4) (3 , 4) (4 , 4) (5 , 4) (6 , 4) (1 , 5) (2 , 5) (3 , 5) (4 , 5) (5 , 5) (6 , 5) (1 , 6) (2 , 6) (3 , 6) (4 , 6) (5 , 6) (6 , 6) Compute the probability of the following events: ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 19 A = { sum = 7 } , B = { 8 < sum ≤ 11 } and C = { 10 < sum } . Solution: The sample space is as shown for the previous problem. The number of elements of the sample space resulting in event A ≡{ sum = 7 } is equal to | A | = 6 where | A | shows the cardinality (number of element) of the set A . This results in P ( A ) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6 . For event B ≡{ 8 < sum ≤ 11 } , we have, | B | = 9 = ⇒ P ( B ) = 9 / 36 = 1 / 4 and for event C ≡{ 10 < sum } , we have, | C | = 3 = ⇒ P ( C ) = 3 / 36 = 1 / 12 . 15. Given two events A and B , belonging to the same sample space, with P ( A ) = 0 . 4 and P ( B ) = 0 . 7 . What are the maximum and minimum possible values for P ( AB ) ? Solution: The maximum value of P ( AB ) is equal to P ( A ) = 0 . 4 and happens if A ⊂ B . The minimum value of P ( AB ) is 0 . 1 and happens if A ∪ B = S . 16. A and B have a and b dollars, respectively. They repeatedly toss a fair coin. If a head appears, A gets 1 dollar from B ; if a tail appears, B gets 1 dollar from A . The game goes on until one of the players is ruined. Determine the probability that A is ruined. Solution: The solution is easier to ﬁnd if we consider a more general problem. Suppose that, at a given moment, A has n dollars, and hence B has a + b − n dollars. Let P n be the probability that, given this scenario, A is eventually ruined. We notice that after one tossing, A will have either n + 1 , or n − 1 dollars each with probability 1 / 2 . Deﬁne the following events, W ≡ A has currently n dollars, A wins in the next tossing, and A is ﬁnally ruined. L ≡ A has currently n dollars, A losses in the next tossing, and A is ﬁnally ruined. We have, P ( W ) = P n +1 / 2 P ( L ) = P n − 1 / 2 P ( A is ruined ) = P ( W ∪ L ) = P ( W ) + P ( L ) Note that W and L are disjoint. This results in, P n = 1 2  P n +1 + 1 2  P n − 1 . Both of the characteristics roots of this recursive equation are equal to one. From this observation we conclude that P n = C 1 + C 2 n The constants C 1 and C 2 are determined by noting that P a + b = 0 (for if A possesses all the money, he cannot be ruined) and P 0 = 1 (for if A has no money, he is ruined from the beginning!). Using these conditions, a simple calculation shows that P n = 1 − n a + b By taking n = a , we ﬁnd that the probability is b/ ( a + b ) that A is ruined. In the same way, it is found that the probability is a/ ( a + b ) that B is ruined. Suppose that A starts the game with a = 10 dollars and B with b = 100 dollars. The probability of ruin for A is then 100 / 110 = 0 . 91 . Conclusion: Do not gamble with people who are richer than you! 17. In a standard deck of 52 cards there are 13 spades. Two cards are drawn at random. Determine the probability that both are spades. ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 20 Solution: The number of favorable cases is equal to the number of combinations of 2 elements from among 13, and the number of possible cases is equal to the number of combinations of 2 elements from among 52. That is, we get P ( A ) =  13 2 ! , 52 2 ! = 1 / 17 18. Suppose we roll 6 dice. What is the probability of A = “We get exactly two 4’s”? Solution: One way that A can occur is x 1 4 2 x 3 4 4 x 5 x 6 where x stands for “not a 4.” Since the six events “die one shows x ”, “die two shows 4,” . . . ,“die six shows x ” are independent, the indicated pattern has probability 5 6  · 1 6  · 5 6  · 1 6  · 5 6  · 5 6 =  1 6  2  5 6  4 Here we have been careful to say “pattern” rather than “outcome” since the given pattern corresponds to 5 4 outcomes in the sample space of 6 6  possible outcomes for 6 dice. Each pattern that results in A corresponds to a choice of 2 of the 6 trials on which a 4 will occur, so the number of patterns is C 6 2 . When we write out the probability of each pattern there will be two 1/6’s and four 5/6’s so each pattern has the same probability and P ( A ) =  6 2 !  1 6  2  5 6  4 19. In a bridge hand, what is the probability each player will be dealt exactly one ace? Solution: Unlike the computations required for poker hands, here we need to consider simultaneously four 13-card hands. To visualize the basic counting technique, think of the 52 cards laid out in a row. Under 13 of the cards imagine an N ; under 13 others, an S ; under 13 others, an E ; and under the remaining 13, a W . That permutation of N ’s, S ’s, E ’s, and W ’s would determine the hands received by North, South, East, and West, respectively. There are 52! ways to permute the 52 cards and there are 13! ways to permute each of the hands. Clearly, the total number of ways to deal the four hands will equal to, 52! 13!13!13!13! By a similar argument, the aces can be distributed, one to a player, in 4!/1!1!1!1! ways, and for each of those distributions, the remaining 48 cards can be dealt in 48!/12!12!12!12! ways. The Fundamental Principle states that if operation A can be performed in m diﬀerent ways and operation B in n diﬀerent ways, the sequence (operation A , operation B ) can be performed in m · n diﬀerent ways. Thus, by the Fundamental Principle, the probability of each player receiving exactly one ace is 4! (1!) 4 · 48! (12!) 4 52! (13!) 4 = 4!(13) 4 48! 52! or 0.105. ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 21 20. In the game of bridge the entire deck of 52 cards is dealt out to 4 players. What is the probability that one of the players receives 13 spades? Solution: There are  52 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 ! possible divisions of the cards among the four distinct players. As there are  39 13 , 13 , 13 ! possible divisions of the cards leading to a ﬁxed player having all 13 spades, it follows that the desired probability is given by 4  39 13 , 13 , 13 !  52 13 , 13 , 13 , 13 ! ≈ 6 . 3 × 10 − 12 One could also solve this problem by taking into account that 13 cards can be selected in  52 13 ! ways and one of these selection corresponds to 13 spades, then the desired probability is equal to, 4  52 13 ! where the factor 4 accounts for the fact that there are four players each having the same probability of receiving the 13 spades. 21. If 2 balls are “randomly drawn” from a bowl containing 6 white and 5 black balls, what is the probability that one of the drawn balls is white and the other is black? Solution: If we regard the order in which the balls are selected as being signiﬁcant, then the sample space consists of 11 · 10 = 110 points. Furthermore, there are 6 · 5 = 30 ways in which the ﬁrst ball selected is white and the second black. Similarly, there are 5 · 6 = 30 ways in which the ﬁrst ball is black and the second white. Hence, assuming that “randomly drawn” means that each of the 110 points in the sample space are equally likely to occur, we see that the desired probability is 30 + 30 110 = 6 11 This problem could also have been solved by regarding the outcome of the experiment as the (unordered) set of drawn balls. From this point of view, there would be  11 2 ! =55 points in the sample space. Using this second representation of the experiment, we see that the desired probability is  6 1 ! 5 1 !  11 2 ! = 6 11 which agrees with the earlier answer. 22. How many integers between 100 and 999 have distinct digits, and how many of those are odd? Solution: Think of the integers as being an arrangement of a hundreds digit, a tens digit, and a units digit. The hundreds digit can be ﬁlled in any of 9 ways (0s are inadmissible), the tens place in any of 9 ways ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 22 (anything but what appears in the hundreds place), and the units place in any of 8 ways (the ﬁrst two digits must not be repeated). Thus, the number of integers between 100 and 999 with distinct digits is 9 · 9 · 8 , or 648. (9) 100s (9) 10s (8) 1s To compute the number of odd integers with distinct digits, we ﬁrst consider the units place, where any of 5 integers can be positioned (1,3,5,7, or 9). Then, turning to the hundreds place, we have 8 choices (the 0 is inadmissible; so is whatever appeared in the units place). The same number of choices is available for the tens place. Multiplying these numbers together gives 8 · 8 · 5 = 320 as the number of odd integers in the range 100-999. 23. In a deck of cards there are 52 cards consisting of 4 suits with 13 denominations in each. A poker deal contains 5 randomly selected cards. A “full house” means that the player receives 3 cards of one denomination and 2 cards of another denomination; “three-of-a-kind” means that he gets 3 cards of one denomination, 1 of another denomination and 1 of a third denomination. Determine the probability of a full house and the probability of a three-of-a-kind. Solution: (a) Full House The number of possible poker deals is  52 5 ! . The favorable cases are found as follows. The denominations for the 3-cards and the 2-cards can be selected in 13 · 12 ways. There are  4 3 ! ways of selecting 3 cards from 4 cards with the same denomination; analogously, there are  4 2 ! ways of taking out 2 cards. Hence the number of favorable cases is 13 · 12 ·  4 3 ! ·  4 2 ! , and the probability we want becomes 13 · 12  4 3 ! 4 2 ! , 52 5 ! ≈ 1 694 (b) Three-of-a-kind The denomination for the 3-cards, the 1-card and the 1-card can be chosen in 13 ·  12 2 ! ways. Hence we ﬁnd, in about the same way as in (a), the probability 13 ·  12 2 ! 4 3 ! 4 1 ! 4 1 ! , 52 5 ! ≈ 1 47 24. Suppose we select two marbles at random from a bag containing four white and six red marbles. What is the probability that we select one of each color? Solution: There are C 10 2 outcomes in the sample space. We can choose one white marble in C 4 1  ways and one red marble in C 6 1  ways.Thus the desired probability is P ( one white, one red ) =  4 1 ! 6 1 !  10 2 ! = 24 45 Alternatively, we may call the event “one white, one red” the event (w, r) ∪ (r, w) and since these are disjoint events, the probability is (4 / 10)(6 / 9) + (6 / 10)(4 / 9) = 24 / 45 ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 23 25. A random experiment consists of selecting at random an integer between 100 and 499. What is the probability of the following events: (a) “the selected integer contains at least one 1”, and (b) “the selected integer contains exactly two 2’s”? Solution: The number of possible outcomes is 400. (a) Let E be the desired event. It is more simple to compute P ( ¯ E ) ﬁrst. For  ¯ E to happen the ﬁrst digit can be 2, 3, or 4, and the other two digits can be any of 2, 3, . . . , 9. Thus P ( E ) = 1 − P ( ¯ E ) = 1 − 3 . 9 . 9 400 = . 6075 (b) For this event we can have the following cases: x 2 2 , 2 x 2, 2 2 x. In the ﬁrst case x can be 1, 3, or 4, and in the two latter cases x can be any digit except 2.Thus P ( exactly two 2’s ) = 3 + 9 + 9 400 = . 0525 26. Suppose we pick 4 balls out of an urn with 12 red balls and 8 black balls. What is the probability of B = “We get two balls of each color”? Solution: There are  20 4 ! = 20 · 19 · 18 · 17 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 = 5 · 19 · 3 · 17 = 4 , 845 ways of picking 4 balls out of the 20. To count the number of outcomes in B , we note that there are  12 2 ! ways to choose the red balls and  8 2 ! ways to choose the black balls, so the multiplication rule implies | B | =  12 2 ! 8 2 ! = 12 · 11 1 · 2 ·  8 · 7 1 · 2 = 6 · 11 · 4 · 7 = 1 , 848 It follows that P ( B ) = 1848/4845=0.3814. 27. In a game of bridge, each of the four players gets 13 cards. If North and South have 8 spades between them, what is the probability that East has 3 spades and West has 2? Solution: We can imagine that ﬁrst North and South take their 26 cards and then East draws his 13 cards from the 26 that remain. Since there are 5 spades and 21 nonspades, the probability he receives 3 spades and 10 nonspades is  5 3 ! 21 10 ! /  26 13 ! . To compute the last probability it is useful to observe that  5 3 ! 21 10 !  26 13 ! = 5! 3!2!  · 21! 10!11! 26! 13!13! = 13! 3!10!  · 13! 2!11! 26! 5!21! =  13 3 ! 13 2 !  26 5 ! To arrive at the answer on the right-hand side directly, think of 26 blanks, the ﬁrst thirteen being East’s cards, the second thirteen being West’s. We have to pick 5 blanks for spades, which can be done in  26 5 ! ways, while the number of ways of giving East 3 spades and West 2 spades is  13 3 ! 13 2 ! . After some cancellation the right-hand side is 13 · 2 · 11 · 13 · 6 26 · 5 · 2 · 23 · 22 = 22 , 308 65 , 708 = 0 . 3395 ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 24 Multiplying the last answer by 2, we see that with probability 0.6782 the ﬁve outstanding spades will be divided 3-2, that is, one opponent will have 3 and the other 2. Similar computations show that the probabilities of 4-1 and 5-0 splits are 0.2827 and 0.0391. 28. In an urn there are N slips of paper marked 1 , 2 , .., N . Slips are drawn at random, one at a time, until the urn is empty. If slip no. i is obtained at the i th drawing, we say that a “rencontre” has occurred. Find the probability of at least one rencontre. This problem is called the problem of rencontre or the matching problem. Solution: If A i = “rencontre at the i th drawing”, we can write the required probability P as P = P ( N [ 1 A i ) The Addition Theorem for Three Events states that: P ( A ∪ B ∪ C ) = P ( A ) + P ( B ) + P ( C ) − P ( AB ) − P ( AC ) − P ( BC ) + P ( ABC ) By generalizing this theorem to N events, we have the general addition formula P ( N [ 1 A i ) = X i P ( A i ) − X i<j P ( A i A j ) + X i<j<k P ( A i A j A k ) + . . . + ( − 1) N − 1 P ( N \ 1 A i ) In the ﬁrst sum there are N terms, in the second sum  N 2 ! terms, and so on. Consider a general term P( A i 1 A i 2 ...A i r ), which expresses the probability of rencontre in drawings i 1 , i 2 , ..., i r . Let us compute the probability. The total number of possible cases for the N drawings is N !. Favorable cases are where the slips i 1 , i 2 , ..., i r appear in the drawings with these numbers, while the remaining slips can appear in any order in the other drawings; this gives ( N − r )! possibilities. Hence we have P ( A i 1 A i 2 ...A i r ) = ( N − r )! /N ! If this is inserted into the expression given before, we ﬁnd P ( N [ 1 A i ) = N ·  ( N − 1)! N ! −  N 2 ! ·  ( N − 2)! N ! + · · · + ( − 1) N − 1  N N ! 1 N ! or, after a reduction, P = 1 − 1 2! + 1 3!  −· · · + ( − 1) N − 1 1 N ! For large N this is approximately equal to 1 − e − 1  = 0.63. The problem of rencontre was ﬁrst discussed by Montmort at the beginning of the eighteenth century. 29. A carnival operator wants to set up a ring-toss game. Players will throw a ring of diameter d on to a grid of squares, the side of each square being of length s (see the following ﬁgure). If the ring lands entirely inside a square, the player wins a prize. To ensure a proﬁt, the operator must keep the player’s chances of winning down to something less than one in ﬁve. How small can the operator make the ratio d/s ? Solution: First, it will be assumed that the player is required to stand far enough away so that no skill is involved and the ring is falling at random on the grid. We see that in order for the ring not to touch any side of the square, the ring’s center must be somewhere in the interior of a smaller square, each side of which ©A. K. Khandani, E&CE307—Fall 2024 25 s s d d/2 s s is a distance d/ 2 from one of the grid lines. Since the area of a grid square is s 2  and the area of an interior square is ( s − d ) 2 , the probability of a winning toss can be written as a simple ratio: P ( ring touches no lines ) = ( s − d ) 2 s 2 But the operator requires that ( s − d ) 2 s 2 ≤ 0 . 20 Solving for d/s gives d s  ≥ 1 − √ 0 . 20 = 0 . 55 That is, if the diameter of the ring is at least 55% as long as the side of one of the squares, the player will have no more than a 20 % chance of winning. 30. Two friends agree to meet “sometime around 12:30.” But neither of them is particularly punctual - or patient. What will actually happen is that each will arrive at random sometime in the interval from 12:00 to 1:00. If one arrives and the other is not there, the ﬁrst person will wait 15 min or until 1:00, whichever comes ﬁrst, and then leave. What is the probability the two will get together? Solution: To simplify notation, we can represent the time period from 12:00 to 1:00 as the interval from 0 to 60 min. Then if x and y denote the two arrival times, the sample space is the 60 × 60 square shown in the ﬁgure below. Furthermore, the event M , “the two friends meet,” will occur if and only if | x − y | ≤ 15 or, equivalently, if and only if − 15 ≤ x − y ≤ 15 . These inequalities appear as the shaded region in the ﬁgure below. Notice that the areas of the two triangles above and below M are each equal to  1 2 (45)(45) . It follows that ©A. K.
